# Challenge Instructions

Thanks for your interest in becoming a member of iFit's front end team! As part of the application process, we ask that you complete the following challenge.✅

## What do I do?

This repo includes a very basic initialization of the `create-react-app` framework, along with the challenge instructions.✅

Your task is to build out a single page section based on the provided designs (included below under Required Assets). Your work will be judged based on how well it matches the designs, how well you've implemented at least basic responsive functionality, and your code's cleanliness and structure. ✅

## How do I submit?

Here's the ideal workflow:
- Fork this repository ✅
- Make it look amazing ✅
- Push your version up to a public repository ✅
- Submit the link in your communications with our hiring department
- (Optional): host your code at a live URL and share that link, as well 

## How long do I have?

Although there's no hard time limit, we ask that you shoot to complete the actual coding portion within 2 hours of starting (on your honor). ✅
